agent = in-vm agent or remote poller agent (can be multi-tennant)
master = aep

agent connects with
  hosts and capabilities

master tells it which work to do

if agent wants to gracefully disconnect, it asks to leave and

agents that wish to update themselves can spawn the new version,
ask to disconnect, and then exit.  The master will move their work
to the new version before they exit.
